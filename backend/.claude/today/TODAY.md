```
https://placedon-hr.vercel.app        GET /  200
  POST /api/ask   → routes deductions to code, abstains naming the weakest link
  POST /api/diagnose, /check          → the free PoSH checker
  GET  /api/generate/templates        → three documents
```

`scripts/verify.py` — **GO, 38 checks.** Inference spend, all time: **₹0.00**.

## The gap worth knowing about

**Three working document generators are reachable by nobody.** `ic_order`, `posh_policy` and
`board_report` are built, tested 25/25, and deployed as API endpoints — but `/generate` returns
**404**, because the Next frontend was never deployed. Only `curl` can reach them.

That matters this month: the Board's Report extract exists for a filing due at AGMs by
**30 September**, and a person cannot open it. Deploying the frontend is ~2 hours and it is mine.
See `docs/PLAN.md` §2.

## What is finished

Everything I can finish alone. The pipeline is wired end to end and deployed: routing,
retrieval with a measured relevance floor, the epistemic gate, generation behind a budget
cap, and post-hoc enforcement that now catches fabricated sub-clauses and footnote figures.
Transcription against the India Code PDF is provable on demand — `scripts/check_transcription.py`,
30/30.

## What is not, and cannot be by me

```
PoSH sections a lawyer has verified   0 / 30      →  6 carry the actual work
Conversations with a potential buyer  0
The email to dcurban@kar.nic.in       DRAFTED, UNSENT
```

**The email.** In your Drafts. There is no send tool in the Gmail integration — this one is
two clicks and it is the only thing standing between the product and a real Bengaluru deadline.

**The lawyer.** `corpus/review_pack.html` is generated and now tiered by *why* each section is
included: 6 carry a reading of ours, 6 we only quote, 3 are closure-only and can be skipped.
`docs/LAWYER_BRIEF.md` has the email and the price. Six sections is less than an evening.

**The calls.** Two questions, in `docs/PLAN.md`. The answer to the first decides whether the
buyer is HR or the company secretary — which is the one open question in `docs/WHERE_WE_ARE.md`
that no amount of code resolves.

## The line the site prints today

> *"This is a prototype, and none of these rules have been checked by a lawyer yet."*

That sentence comes off the day someone signs. Nothing else changes it.
