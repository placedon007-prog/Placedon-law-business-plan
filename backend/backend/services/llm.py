"""
The only file that talks to Anthropic. Every paid call goes through here.

Corrections against the spec, each load-bearing:

  * **Model.** The spec names `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, which retired 2025-10-28 and
    returns 404. We route to `claude-haiku-4-5` (DECISIONS D-3) — safe here precisely because
    the LLM never decides anything: `applicability.py` decides, and every number in the output
    is checked verbatim against source afterward. Model choice is a cost lever, not a
    correctness lever.

  * **FX.** The spec hardcodes $1 = ₹83. It is ₹95.23 (2026-08-06), so every cost the spec
    computes is ~13% under-reported. We use the rate in `backend/budget.py`, in one place.

  * **Cost.** The spec budgets ₹3–5 per answer, which is Opus-tier pricing applied to a
    mid-tier model. Measured on Haiku 4.5 at ~6,700 in / ~700 out: **₹0.97**.

  * **Budget.** The spec tracks spend and raises after the fact. `BudgetTracker.can_make_call()`
    runs *before* the request, so an exhausted budget degrades to template mode rather than
    discovering the overrun in a log.

    Raised when asked to explain a provision no lawyer has verified.

    The abstention gate lived in `ask_engine` alone — one `if` in one caller. That is a
    convention, not a property: a second caller (the RAG pipeline every planning document
    proposes) would reach this function directly and explain unverified law to a user, fluently
    and with a real citation, while the documentation went on describing the system as
    abstaining.

    So the module that spends the money and produces the prose refuses on its own account. The
    gate in `ask_engine` stays — two independent guards, and the failure of either is survivable.

You are not deciding anything. A deterministic rules engine has already decided what the law
requires and which provisions apply. Your only job is to explain the text you are given.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Answer ONLY using the provided legal text. Do not use outside knowledge, even if you are
   confident it is correct.
2. If the answer is not in the text, say "I don't have verified information on this."
3. Cite the exact section number for every claim, in square brackets.
4. Never state a number — a threshold, a deadline, a penalty, a headcount — unless that exact
   number appears in the provided text. Every figure you write is checked against the source
   afterward, and a figure that is not there causes the whole answer to be discarded.
5. Do not generalise. "Usually", "typically", "in most states" are forbidden.
6. Use simple language. The reader is an HR manager, not a lawyer.
7. Format: direct answer, then the citation, then the action if there is one.

You are NOT giving legal advice. You are relaying cited information from verified sources."""
