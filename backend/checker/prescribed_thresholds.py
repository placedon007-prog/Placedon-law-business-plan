"""Dated statutory thresholds, each carrying how well we actually know it.

s.2(85) does not state the small-company thresholds operatively. It states a
floor and a ceiling and then delegates:

    "(i) paid-up share capital of which does not exceed fifty lakh rupees or
     such higher amount AS MAY BE PRESCRIBED which shall not be more than
     [ten crore rupees]; [and] (ii) turnover of which [as per profit and loss
     account for the immediately preceding financial year] does not exceed two
     crore rupees or such higher amount as may be prescribed which shall not be
     more than [one hundred crore rupees]"

    -- quoted from our own corpus of the Act, not from recollection.

So the number that decides a real company is in a delegated rule, and the
widely-cited ₹4 crore / ₹40 crore appear nowhere in the Act. A classifier that
hardcoded them would be asserting a Rule it has never read.

## Why this file refuses rather than answers

Every threshold carries a provenance state from checker.provenance. `lookup()`
returns only what is SERVABLE. The prescribed amounts are NOT servable today:

  * India Code lists the operative instrument -- G.S.R. 700(E) of 15-09-2022,
    handle 123456789/508916 -- and its text bitstream is reachable.
  * But indiacode.gov.in/robots.txt has been answering **HTTP 502** on every
    attempt, and checker.robots fails closed on a 5xx: a 4xx means "no rules
    exist", a 5xx means "we cannot know what the rules are". So the compliant
    fetcher declines, correctly.
  * The reading recorded below was obtained OUTSIDE that gate and came back
    paraphrased rather than verbatim. It is a lead, not an acquisition. It is
    recorded so the work is not repeated, and marked so it cannot be served.

The consequence is deliberate: a small-company classification is
INSUFFICIENT_DATA until the instrument is acquired properly. That is the correct
answer today, and it is a better one than a confident number nobody verified.
