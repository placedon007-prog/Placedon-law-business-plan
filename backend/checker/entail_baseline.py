"""Deterministic entailment baseline. No model.

This is the number a model has to beat before it earns a place in the pipeline.
It exists because the mining measurement was surprising: I expected lexical
overlap to be near-useless on the hard negatives and it reached 87% on the
matched subset. If simple checks get most of the way, the honest outcome may be
to ship them and skip the model entirely — a deterministic checker can be read,
tested, and explained to a regulator, which no fine-tuned classifier can.

## What it checks, in order of legal weight

1. **Quoted spans must appear.** If a hypothesis quotes text in double quotes,
   that text must be present in the premise. This decides the matched subset
   outright — the whole difference between a prior-wording claim and a
   current-wording claim is whether the quoted words are there.
2. **Numbers must agree.** Every numeral and word-numeral in the hypothesis must
   appear in the premise. A claim inventing "two years" where the premise says
   "one year" is refused on the number alone.
3. **Dates must agree.** A date in the hypothesis must be derivable from a date
   in the premise. This catches the shifted-year negatives.
4. **Named instruments must appear.** "Act 1 of 2018" in a claim must be in the
   premise.
5. **Lexical support**, last and weakest: the remaining content words must be
   sufficiently covered.

The ordering matters. Checks 1-4 are *hard* and refuse outright; only step 5 is a
threshold. A system that reduced all of this to one similarity score would accept
a claim that matched in tone and lied about the date.

## The score is 1.00 and that is a warning, not a result

On the frozen set this baseline reaches accuracy 1.00 overall and 1.00 on the
matched subset, with a false-current rate of 0.00. **Do not read that as evidence
that grounding is solved.**

The frozen hypotheses are constructed by altering exactly one checkable token —
a date, a numeral, a named instrument, a quoted span. This checker inspects
exactly those tokens. The benchmark therefore cannot distinguish a genuinely
capable checker from one tuned to its own construction, and a near-perfect score
is what near-circularity looks like from the inside.

What the number does support: for claims of this *shape* — quoting a span,
naming an instrument, stating a commencement date, asserting a period — the
deterministic checks are sufficient, and no model is needed. That covers a real
part of what the drafting layer emits, and a checker that can be read and tested
beats a classifier that cannot.

What it does not support: any claim about paraphrased output. A real model
hallucination restates rather than token-swaps, and surface matching will do far
worse there. Closing that needs pairs whose hypotheses preserve meaning while
changing surface form — which is E4's actual job, and is not "train something to
beat 1.00".

## Measured against hand-written paraphrases: 1/4. This is the ceiling.

`corpus/benchmark/entailment_v1.json` holds four claims about s.173 written by
hand rather than templated. This checker gets **1 of 4**, and every error is a
false accept — it declares three false statements of law SUPPORTED.

The two decisive cases:

- *"...within ninety days of incorporation"* (gold UNSUPPORTED). "ninety days"
  really does occur in s.173 — governing the **gap between two meetings**, not
  the first-meeting deadline. The claim takes a genuine quantity from the
  provision and attaches it to the wrong obligation. Checking numeral-with-unit
  as a pair, which fixed the constructed set, does nothing here.
- *"...file a return of each meeting with the Registrar..."* (gold UNSUPPORTED).
  "return" and "Registrar" occur **zero** times in s.173, yet coverage stays
  above threshold because they are 2 content words out of ~10. Raising the
  threshold cannot separate them: e01 (true) and e02 (false) both score 0.667,
  because the borrowed vocabulary *is* the provision's.

This is the failure Magesh et al. call inapplicable authority — every
distinctive term present, the proposition false — and it is structural. No
threshold, no additional token check, and no amount of tuning against the
constructed set reaches it, because the error is in how the proposition binds
its terms together, not in which terms it uses.

**Conclusion.** This checker is retained as a cheap fail-closed pre-filter: it
never produced a false accept on the matched subset and it catches token-level
substitution reliably. It must never be the gate that establishes GROUNDED. A
claim it accepts is *not obviously wrong*; that is a different statement from
*supported by the cited text*, and conflating the two is how a system serves a
false statement of law with a citation attached.

## Bias toward refusal

Ambiguity resolves to NOT_ENTAILED. In this domain a false accept means repealed
wording served as current law; a false reject means an abstention. Those are not
symmetric costs and the threshold is not tuned as though they were.
