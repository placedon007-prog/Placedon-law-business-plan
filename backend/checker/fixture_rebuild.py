"""Rebuild invalid fixtures as *proposed* qualified claims. Nothing is approved here.

Nine fixtures were invalidated by the fail-closed convention: each states a real
quantity-to-obligation binding, but states it unconditionally where the provision
carries a material qualifier. "Section 103 sets two members as the quorum for a
private company" is a true statement of the binding and a misleading statement of
the law, because s.103(1) opens with "Unless the articles of the company provide
for a larger number".

This module proposes replacements. It does not decide them.

## Why the originals are preserved rather than edited

An invalid fixture is evidence. It records a claim shape that looked correct to
its author and was not, which is exactly the material a benchmark exists to
capture. Overwriting it would destroy the only record of why the replacement was
needed, and would make the transformation unauditable. So originals are kept
permanently with their invalidation reason, and every replacement names the
fixture it supersedes and the exact transformation applied.

## The model proposes; it does not label

Every replacement is emitted `HUMAN_JUDGED` / `PENDING_REVIEW`. Prepending a
verified qualifier is mechanical, but deciding that the result *preserves the
legal meaning* is not — it is the judgement under test. A replacement that
assigned itself ENTAILED would be a model marking its own homework, which is the
failure both cited studies refuse.
