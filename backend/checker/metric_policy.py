"""The release gate: what a verifier configuration must satisfy to ship.

Accuracy alone cannot gate a legal verifier. On a set that is 66% negative,
"always NOT_ENTAILED" scores 0.66 with F1 0.00 — it accepts nothing, ever, and
would pass any accuracy threshold below that while being useless. Afane et al.
(CSLAW 2026) measured exactly this: an all-affirmative baseline scoring F1 0.73
against Westlaw AI's 0.64 and Lexis+ AI's 0.41.

So the gate is four conditions, and a configuration must satisfy all of them:

    false-accept ceiling   an unsupported claim served as supported is the
                           legally dangerous error. It is capped in absolute
                           count, not as a rate, because a rate hides how many
                           wrong answers a reviewer actually sees.
    F1 floor               stops a refuse-everything configuration passing.
    abstention cap         stops a configuration passing by declining most
                           items. Abstention is safe; it is not free.
    per-bucket reporting   an aggregate can hide a bucket at zero. Every
                           bucket is reported and none may be worse than the
                           majority baseline on false accepts.

The majority-class baseline is printed with every result, always. A score
without it is not a result.
