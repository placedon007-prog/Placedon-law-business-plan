"""The company facts a Companies Act obligation is decided against.

The existing `CompanyProfile` in applicability.py is labour-law shaped —
employee_count, establishment_type, ESI wage ceilings, hazardous process. None
of it decides a Companies Act question. This is the corporate profile.

It holds **facts only**. No statutory threshold appears in this file, and that is
a deliberate line: a threshold is dated law that changes by amendment and by
delegated rule, so it belongs in a sourced rule table, not baked into a schema.
A profile that knew the thresholds would silently keep answering with last
year's law.

## Unknown is a value, not a zero

Every field may be None, and None means "we were not told". applicability.evaluate
already maps a None field to INSUFFICIENT_DATA with a trace naming the field, so
an unknown turnover produces "need this to decide" rather than a quiet
DOES_NOT_APPLY. Nothing here may default a missing figure to 0: for a threshold
of the form "does not exceed X", zero is the strongest possible pass, so
defaulting an unknown to zero converts ignorance into a favourable answer.

## Money is whole rupees, and it says what it is worth

Indian thresholds are quoted in lakhs and crores while figures arrive in rupees,
and the mis-scaling is silent — ₹4 crore entered as "4" passes every "does not
exceed" test ever written. `Money` stores whole rupees as an int and offers
`lakh()` and `crore()` constructors so the unit is stated at the point of entry
rather than assumed at the point of comparison.

## A figure without its financial year is not a figure

s.2(85)(ii) does not ask for turnover. It asks for turnover "as per profit and
loss account for the **immediately preceding financial year**" — text quoted from
our own corpus, not from memory. A turnover carried without the year it belongs
to cannot answer that question, so `Figure` binds the amount to its financial
year and a comparison against the wrong year is refused rather than computed.

## Derived status is computed, never stored

There is no `is_small_company` field. Small-company status is a function of
capital, turnover, company class and three exclusions, every one of which can be
unknown — and a stored flag drifts from its inputs the moment one changes.
Classification lives in `classify.py` and returns a Result with a trace.
