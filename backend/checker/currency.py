"""Corpus currency — does each obligation rest on law we can show is current?

Legora ships this as "Monitors", Harvey as "Horizon Scanning": both of the
best-funded players in this lane sell "the law changed" as a headline product
(sourced in docs/TECHNICAL_PLAN_EVIDENCED_2026_09.md §1). This module is that
primitive at our scale and under our discipline.

It fetches nothing and invents no amount. It maps each obligation to the dated
instrument its answer depends on, then rolls up the acquisition/currency state
those instruments ALREADY carry -- in prescribed_thresholds and the registration
records -- into one obligation-level view: is the legal basis CURRENT, not yet in
force, SUPERSEDED (we may be serving stale law), or UNACQUIRED?

## Why an engine and not a flag per obligation

An obligation that silently rests on an unacquired rule renders green while
standing on law we have never read. s.2(85) small-company status is exactly that
today: it depends on G.S.R. 700(E), which is UNACQUIRED (S-002). Rather than let
that hide inside a threshold lookup, this surfaces it as a first-class signal
naming the instrument to acquire. And when a NEWER amendment lands that we have
not caught up to, `SUPERSEDED` says so instead of quietly serving the old amount.

## What CURRENT does and does not claim

CURRENT means the instrument the obligation depends on is servable and in force
at the as-of date. For obligations resting only on the Companies Act text we hold
verbatim (VERIFIED in the corpus), CURRENT is as strong as our claim to hold the
current Act -- whose own currency is tracked by the corpus law-effective-date,
not here. This module governs the delegated-rule layer, which is where thresholds
actually move.
