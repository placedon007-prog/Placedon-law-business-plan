"""The frozen entailment benchmark: load it, or refuse.

A benchmark that regenerates itself whenever the miner changes cannot measure
progress — every improvement in the generator silently moves the target, and a
score from Tuesday is not comparable to a score from Monday. So the pairs are
written once, hashed, and the loader verifies the hash on every read.

## Refusing is the feature

`load()` raises if the file's digest does not match the manifest. It does not
warn, re-derive, or fall back to mining fresh pairs. A benchmark that quietly
repairs itself is indistinguishable from one that was never frozen.

Re-freezing is deliberate and awkward on purpose: `--refreeze` must name the
digest being replaced, so it cannot happen by reflex or by a script.

## Why the headline number is per-kind

The set is 34% `quoted_span` — positives whose hypothesis is lifted verbatim from
the premise. They are trivially easy, and a single pooled accuracy over them
would read as competence the system has not demonstrated. `evaluate()` therefore
returns per-kind metrics and refuses to emit one pooled figure, in the same
spirit as reporting n alongside every rate.

The number that matters is on the **matched** subset: `prior_as_current` against
`current_wording`, where the only difference between an entailed and a
not-entailed pair is whether the quoted words are still in force.
