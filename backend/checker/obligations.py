"""The obligation register — rows generated from a company, not from documents.

This is the inversion the whole product rests on, and it is worth stating
before the code:

    In tabular contract review a row is A DOCUMENT YOU HAVE.
    In a compliance matrix a row is AN OBLIGATION THE LAW IMPOSES.

The consequence is that the most valuable rows are the ones with NO document
behind them. A company that has held no board meeting all year still gets a
row saying so, and that row is the one a director needs. A document-mass
architecture cannot generate it: a corpus can only be asked about what is in
it. This register is generated from a `CompanyProfile` alone, so a company that
has uploaded nothing still gets a complete matrix.

## Every row is one of five things, and they are not interchangeable

    APPLIES_SATISFIED       the duty attaches and the evidence shows it met
    APPLIES_NOT_SATISFIED   the duty attaches and the evidence shows it unmet
    APPLIES_UNDETERMINED    the duty attaches; we cannot say whether it is met
    DOES_NOT_APPLY          the duty does not attach to this company
    CANNOT_DETERMINE        we cannot say whether the duty even attaches

The last two are the ones a careless system collapses. "This does not apply to
you" and "I cannot tell whether this applies to you" are different sentences,
and only one of them is safe to act on. `applicability.Result` already keeps
INSUFFICIENT_DATA distinct from DOES_NOT_APPLY; this module keeps that
distinction all the way to the row.

## No obligation states its own threshold

An obligation names its provision and the checker that answers it. Amounts and
dates come from `prescribed_thresholds`, which refuses what it has not
acquired. So a register row can be blocked by a missing Rule, and it says which
one.
