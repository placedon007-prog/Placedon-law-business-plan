"""A retrieval eval set for structural chunk selection — with an honest boundary.

T5 in docs/NEXT_MOVE_PLAN_2026_09_04.md. MODEL_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN §6 step 1: "you
cannot improve retrieval you cannot measure." This is the measurement — a frozen
set of (question → expected chunk path) cases and a precision@1 scorer over the
deterministic selector (`ground_span.select_chunk`).

## The boundary that keeps the score honest

Some question→chunk mappings are *structural*: "the paid-up capital limit for a
small company" points at s.2(85)(i) by the text's own layout, no legal judgement
required. Those are SCORED.

Others require a practitioner to say what the right span even is — e.g. which
provision governs a borderline fact pattern, or whether a proviso carves out a
case. Guessing those and scoring against the guess would manufacture a green
number that means nothing. So every such case is marked `NEEDS_LAWYER`, carries
`expected_path=None`, and is EXCLUDED from the score. They are not failures; they
are the H-B ask in the runbook — the exact list a reviewing lawyer resolves.

The harness therefore reports three things a reader must not conflate: the
precision on what we could score, and the list of what only a lawyer can label,
and the individual misses. A high precision on five structural cases is not a
claim about the whole retrieval problem — it is a claim about five cases.
