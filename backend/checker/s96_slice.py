"""s.96 end to end: source, amendment, commencement, dated text, evidence card.

The first vertical slice. One provision, carried the whole way:

    source packet -> amendment event -> commencement instrument
      -> dated reconstruction -> AGM deadline -> evidence card -> review

Nothing here is s.96-specific except the witness constants. The machinery —
`checker/witness_span.py`, `checker/commencement.py`, `checker/agm.py` — is
general; s.96 is the first provision to have all three available at once.

## Why this section

It is the section the product is built around, and until 27 Aug 2026 it could
not be reconstructed for any date before 13 June 2018: its amendment span is one
of the handful whose closing bracket India Code omits. Both halves of that gap
are now closed by primary instruments rather than by inference — the boundary by
Act 1 of 2018 s.26, which states the substituted text in full, and the effective
date by S.O. 2422(E), which appoints 13 June 2018 for section 26.

## What the card must never do

Assert a deadline without the provision text it was computed from; assert a date
without the instrument that fixed it; or present a reconstruction as verified
when a hash does not match. Every field carries its source, and the card refuses
to render as COMPLETE when any is missing.
