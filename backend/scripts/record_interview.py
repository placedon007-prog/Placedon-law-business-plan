"""
Record one practitioner interview into research/interviews.csv.

Instrumentation, not analysis. It captures what was observed and refuses to capture a conclusion:
there is no "was this validated" field, because the decision rule reads the recorded facts and a
free-text verdict would quietly become the finding.

It also will not invent a participant. Every field is entered by the interviewer or left blank, and
blank means unobserved -- distinct from "no", which is why the observation fields accept y / n / ?
rather than a checkbox.

    python3 scripts/record_interview.py --new         # walk one session interactively
    python3 scripts/record_interview.py --summary     # what the five sessions show so far
    python3 scripts/record_interview.py --test

Run --summary after each interview, not at the end. If three participants have already answered the
question the study exists to ask, the remaining sessions can go deeper instead of repeating it.
