"""Register a human-downloaded G.S.R. 700(E) so the thresholds become servable.

Two official routes to this instrument are blocked and neither is our fault to
fix from here: indiacode.gov.in/robots.txt answers 502, so the compliant fetcher
declines under RFC 9309; and egazette.gov.in sends no intermediate certificate,
chaining to an ISRG root this machine's trust store does not carry. See
corpus/sources/acquisition_gsr700e.json for the full attempt chain.

A person with a browser is not a crawler and has a current trust store, so the
handoff is: download the file, run this, and it verifies, hashes and registers
it. That is the same shape as scripts/acquire_rules.py, which exists because the
same thing happened with the Board Rules.

## What this refuses

Identity, before anything else. India Code carries the principal Rules, six
amendments to them, and consolidated reprints, all with near-identical titles.
Registering an amendment as the principal Rules — or the 2021 amendment as the
2022 one — would silently corrupt every threshold built on top. So the document
must identify itself as G.S.R. 700(E) of 15-09-2022 AND carry the operative
clause, and anything else is rejected with what was found.

## What it does NOT do

It does not set the thresholds to VERIFIED. VERIFIED in this system means a
hashed local artifact PLUS human review, and a script cannot perform the second
half. It moves them to CORROBORATED, prints the clause verbatim for a person to
read, and says what remains.
