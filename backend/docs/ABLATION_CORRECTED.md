# Ablation, corrected — the de-anchored re-run

Measured 2026-09-06 on **all 70** frozen `cross_section_eval` cases with de-anchored
prompts. This run **overturns the headline of the first run**, which was published on
20 cases with prompts that fed the model an example section number.

## What changed, and it is not small

| Tier | first run (anchored, n=20) | **corrected (de-anchored, n=70)** |
|---|---|---|
| V1 base model, no retrieval | 0.00 | **0.00** |
| V2 + dense top-5 | 0.00 | **0.24** |
| V3 PEFT, no retrieval | NOT_RUNNABLE | **NOT_RUNNABLE** |
| V4 + hybrid BM25⊕dense | 0.10 (confounded) | **0.63** |
| V5 V4 + schema-constrained | 0.45 | **0.61** |

Retrieval alone, no model: **RRF fusion p@1 0.80, recall@5 0.97.**

## Correction 1 — the earlier headline was wrong

The first run's sharpest claim was: *"V1 and V2 at exactly 0.00 are the sharpest data
point — handed the right section in its context 90% of the time, the model still could
not name it."*

**That was an artefact of our own prompt.** Both tiers ended with `"for example: 185"`,
and `gemma3:1b` echoed 185. With the example removed, V2 scores **0.24** and V4 scores
**0.63**. The model was not incapable of selecting from evidence; it was being told, in
effect, to answer 185.

The lesson is not about the model. A prompt defect produced a **confident, quotable,
wrong conclusion about a model's capability** — and it survived one round of publication
because the number was plausible in the direction we already believed. It was caught only
by re-inspecting raw outputs on a suspicious delta.

## Correction 2 — schema constraint can now be judged, and it does not help p@1

The first run could not separate schema constraint from example exposure, because V4 and
V5 differed in both. With exposure equalised:

    V4 (no schema constraint)  p@1 0.63
    V5 (schema constrained)    p@1 0.61

**A difference of one case — noise.** Schema constraint does **not** improve which
section the model names. What it does deliver is **schema validity 0.99** (69/70 valid
first try, 1 repair retry). That is the honest split: constrained decoding buys
*parseability*, not *accuracy*. Worth having for a machine-readable pipeline; worth
nothing for correctness.

## What survives unchanged

**V1 is still exactly 0.00 over 70 cases.** With no retrieval and no example, the model
names the correct governing section zero times out of seventy. Whatever `gemma3:1b`
knows, it is not the section numbering of the Companies Act 2013. Retrieval is not an
optimisation here; it is the entire source of the answer.

**Retrieval alone still beats every model tier.** Fusion 0.80 against the best model tier
0.63. So the operative conclusion holds — **no model belongs in the answer path today** —
but the margin is 0.17, not the 0.35 the first run implied, and it is a narrower and more
honest claim.

## llama3 is not usable on this hardware

Measured precisely, not estimated:

- `llama3` (4.7 GB) **loaded in 292 s** and answered a trivial probe (`"reply ok"`).
- The **first real query** — a Companies Act question — **timed out at 900 s**.

Against `gemma3:1b`'s 1.0-1.6 s/query, that is roughly a 600x difference, and it is a
memory-pressure cliff rather than a slope: 4.7 GB of weights on 8 GB of unified memory
leaves nothing for the KV cache, so a real prompt thrashes where a two-token probe does
not. A full matrix is ~280 queries; at 900 s each that is over 70 hours.

Recorded as **measured infeasibility, not a result**. Whether a larger model would beat
fusion's 0.80 remains **untested**, and this hardware cannot settle it. Note the probe
succeeding while the real query failed is exactly the trap this project guards against —
a cheap health check that passes tells you nothing about whether the system works.

## Caveats

- One model (`gemma3:1b`) at n=70; a second model is untested for the reason above.
- V3 was never run and is reported as *not measured*, never 0.00.
- The context ceiling was 0.96-0.97, so retrieval was rarely the limiting factor.
