"""
Jurisdiction resolution — district > state > national.

This module exists because of one research finding: the PoSH annual-return deadline is set by
the **District Officer**, not nationally. Gurugram notified 28 February; most districts use
31 January. "31 January" is a generalisation, not a rule.

`docs/01_CITATION_GRAPH.md` types `jurisdiction` as ISO 3166-2 — 'IN', 'IN-KA' — which stops at
the state. A district-level obligation sits one level below anything that schema can store, so a
naive lookup finds the state record and confidently answers 31 January for a company whose
district says otherwise. That is exactly the failure this company exists to prevent.

The fix is not "add a district column". It is to make the fallback from district to state
**explicit and refusable**: a record marked `district_scoped` must be matched at district level
or the system abstains. Falling back is the bug.

Pure functions, no I/O. Run: python3 jurisdiction.py
