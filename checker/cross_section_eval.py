"""Cross-section retrieval eval: does a plain question reach the right section?

The sub-agent route to expand this hit an account session limit, so the cases are
authored here directly — which is fine, because the label is STRUCTURAL, not a
legal judgement: "a question about loans to directors is governed by s.185" is
read straight off the section's own subject (its title, dumped from the corpus),
not interpreted. Each case is a plain-English question a CS/lawyer would ask,
mapped to the section that governs it.

Measures precision@1 (top hit correct) and recall@5 (correct section in the top
five) for `corpus_retrieval`. As with retrieval_eval, the self-test verifies the
MEASUREMENT and records the numbers; it asserts an honest floor and prints the
failures so the retriever can be improved against them, not tuned to them.
