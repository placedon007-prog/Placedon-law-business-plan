"""The pre-diligence evidence pack — the matrix as a dated, cited document.

This is the artifact that lives inside the discipline rather than trading it
away. A compliance matrix that only says "you are in breach" is worth less than
one that a CFO can hand to diligence counsel, and this renders exactly that:
a company's Companies Act position on a stated date, with the provision behind
every line and an explicit account of what could not be verified.

## What it is, and firmly is not

It IS a record: every row carries its provision, its state, the basis for that
state, and — where the row could not be decided — the fact or the source that is
missing. It carries a provenance block so a reader can reproduce it: which
corpus, which code, which date.

It is NOT any of the following, and the rendered pack says so on its face:

  * It does not generate a resolution, notice, or any operative instrument. It
    reports on obligations; it does not draft the documents that discharge them.
    Drafting a legally operative document is a different liability surface and a
    governance decision this pack does not take.
  * It does not guarantee zero defects. It covers a named set of obligations, not
    the whole Act, against a corpus that holds the Act but almost none of the
    subordinate rules. It can say it did not contradict itself. It cannot say
    nothing is wrong.
  * It is not legal advice, and it is not reviewed by a lawyer.

Stating those limits is not throat-clearing. A pack that overstated what it
established would be the exact failure the whole system is built to avoid, and
it would carry that failure into a due-diligence room where the stakes are real.

## No model, and no operative text

`build()` runs the deterministic obligation register and nothing else. No
language model is consulted, and per s.52(1)(q)(ii) the pack never reproduces
bare statutory text as its own content — it cites provisions and states our
analysis, it does not republish the Act.
