"""Independent corroboration of prior wording, using the amending Act as witness.

The problem this solves is recorded in `docs/RETRACTIONS.md`. We once reported
"119/119 EXACT" for point-in-time reconstruction against what turned out to be the
current consolidation, and later "43/43 prior wordings found in the PDF" — which was
circular, because the footnotes quoting those wordings are *in that same PDF*. Both
were retracted. Every prior wording we hold still comes from one publisher's
footnote, so a defect in India Code's own footnote is invisible to us.

The witness that breaks the circle is the **amending Act**. When the Companies
(Amendment) Act 2017 says

    in clause (p), for the words "annual evaluation has been made by the Board of
    its own performance and that of its committees and individual directors", the
    words "..." shall be substituted

it names the pre-amendment text in a *different document by a different publisher*.
If India Code's footnote and the amending instrument agree, the wording is
corroborated. If they disagree, one of them carries a defect and we have found it.

**What a PASS here does and does not establish.** It establishes that the prior
wording we extracted for one amended span matches the instrument that made the
change. It does *not* establish that a whole reconstructed section is correct: a
section may carry spans we never parsed, un-footnoted editorial changes, or
commencement dates that differ from the w.e.f. we recorded. Section-level
reconstruction remains UNVERIFIED. This module raises the evidence for one
component of it, and the distinction is the whole reason the earlier claims were
retracted.
