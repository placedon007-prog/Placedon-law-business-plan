"""The ablation matrix: which part of the system actually produces the accuracy?

The program's central claim is that accuracy here is a *systems* property, not a model
property — that retrieval, schema constraint and the decision layer carry the number,
and the language model is the smallest contributor rather than the largest. That claim
is worth nothing until it is measured against the alternative, so this module runs the
same task through five configurations and prints what each one scores.

The task is the frozen cross-section eval's own: given a plain question a company
secretary would ask, name the section of the Companies Act 2013 that governs it. The
labels are structural (read off each section's title), not legal judgements, which is
what makes them safe to grade automatically.

## The five tiers

    V1  base model, prompting only, NO retrieval — the model answers from its weights
    V2  base model + dense retrieval (top-5 as context)
    V3  PEFT fine-tuned adapter, no retrieval            — NOT RUNNABLE, see below
    V4  base model + hybrid BM25 top-5 AND dense top-5 as context
    V5  V4 + schema-constrained output: the answer must parse under
        `extraction_schema.validate_section_ref`, with exactly one repair retry

V4 passes both ranked lists, labelled, rather than a fused list. Reciprocal Rank Fusion
is M3 and is not written yet; inventing a fusion here would make V4 measure something
the shipped system does not have.

## V3 is a hole in the matrix, and it stays a hole

There is no CUDA device on this machine (Apple M1, 8 GB unified memory), and the 70
eval cases are a bar rather than a training set — there is no annotated gold set and no
annotators. Both blockers are arithmetic, not judgement. So V3 is emitted as an explicit
NOT_RUNNABLE row carrying its reason. A matrix with an invented row is worse than a
matrix with a stated gap, because the gap is recoverable and the invention is not.

## Nothing is reported that was not measured

The model is probed before anything is graded. If Ollama does not answer, every
model-dependent tier is reported NOT_RUNNABLE with the transport's own reason, and no
number is printed for it. The same holds if the dense index cannot load: V2/V4/V5 go
NOT_RUNNABLE rather than quietly degrading to BM25 and reporting BM25 under a dense
label. If the model dies part-way through a tier, that tier is marked NOT_RUNNABLE with
the case count it reached — a partial run is not a result.

## No tier is anchored by an example

The first run of this matrix ended V4's prompt with "for example: 185" and V5's with
three varied examples. gemma3:1b echoed 185 back for unrelated questions, so the
measured V4->V5 delta was an artefact of the prompt rather than of schema constraint.
Every tier now shares one format rule that describes the answer's shape with digit
placeholders and names no real section, and V5 differs from V4 by the schema clause
alone. `_test()` asserts this by pointing the harness's own answer extractor at each
tier's prompt: if it can find a section number in the instructions, so can the model.

## The sample size is part of every number

gemma3:1b on an M1 is slow enough that all 70 cases across four tiers is a long wall
clock. The harness therefore runs a bounded prefix of the eval, defaults to 20 cases,
and prints the sample size on every line it emits. An unstated sample is a lie by
omission, so `render()` states it whether or not anyone asked. The published run uses
`--sample=70`, i.e. the whole frozen eval.
