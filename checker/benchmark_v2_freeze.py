"""Freeze the human-reviewed benchmark, and refuse to freeze anything else.

Freezing does not mean the benchmark is legally complete. It means the exact
version is fixed, the records cannot change silently, future results are
comparable, every label has an explicit basis, and every human approval is
auditable. Nothing more is claimed.

## What may enter

Only `ENTAILED` and `NOT_ENTAILED` records, and only where a `HUMAN_JUDGED`
label carries an APPROVED review. These are excluded by construction, not by
filtering-and-hoping:

    INVALID_FIXTURE   PENDING_REVIEW   UNRESOLVED
    SOURCE_MISSING    CONTRADICTORY

`freeze()` raises rather than dropping a bad record silently. A freeze that
quietly excludes half its input is indistinguishable from one that worked.

## What this benchmark is

    human-reviewed, corpus-derived benchmark for selected Indian corporate-law
    proposition types

It does **not** measure general legal grounding. Its claims are derived from a
handful of provisions of one Act, its negatives are constructed, and its
positives were written by one reviewer. It is useful for detecting failure modes
and for comparing checkers against each other. It is not evidence that any
system is accurate on real user-generated legal claims.
