"""Paraphrase pairs under the strict grounding convention.

The v1 set contained a contradiction I introduced and did not notice: four
positives stated a rule unconditionally while the provision qualified it, and
structurally identical claims were labelled NOT_ENTAILED elsewhere in the same
file. A checker trained on both receives opposite signal from the same shape.

Under the fail-closed convention an unqualified claim is NOT_ENTAILED whenever
its source carries a material proviso, exception, threshold, condition, scope
limit, or delegated-rule limitation. The defective positives are therefore
**rewritten to carry their qualifiers**, and their original unqualified forms are
**kept as negatives** — which is where they always belonged, and which turns a
mistake into six extra pairs testing precisely the failure mode that motivated
the convention.

## The model does not certify its own work

Every positive whose label rests on reading the provision is `HUMAN_JUDGED` and
carries `reviewer_status = PENDING_REVIEW`. `frozen_candidates()` excludes them.
A model may propose a rewrite and may flag a defect; it may not sign one off.

Negatives built by mechanical rebinding are `CONSTRUCTED` — false because they
were built false. Qualifier inventories are `SOURCE_CHECKED`: each qualifier is
asserted only if its trigger phrase is verified present in the source span, so a
mis-stated inventory fails a test rather than travelling silently.
