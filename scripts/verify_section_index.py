"""Check our number -> section_id index against India Code itself.

    python3 scripts/verify_section_index.py            # the MVP sections
    python3 scripts/verify_section_index.py --all      # every mapped section
    python3 scripts/verify_section_index.py --test     # offline self-test

## Why this exists

`CLAUDE.md` has carried this caveat since 21 Aug 2026:

    Section index: 464/474 mapped, 17 MVP sections hand-verified.
    PDF-derived, not source-confirmed - India Code returned 403.

The index was built by parsing a PDF, so a mis-parse would be invisible: nothing
independent said which section number belongs to which id. Every downstream
answer rests on that mapping, so an unverified mapping is a silent single point
of failure.

## The 403 was a dead domain, not a block

`indiacode.nic.in` still returns 403 to everything. The site moved to
`indiacode.gov.in`, which runs DSpace with an **open REST API** - no key, no
auth. We were being refused by a host that no longer serves the content.

The API exposes `dc.identifier.section_number`, `dc.identifier.section_id` and
`dc.title.act_name` as structured fields, so the mapping can be checked directly
rather than inferred from rendered text.

## One trap this code guards against

`dc.identifier.section_number:96` matches section 96 of *every* Act in the
database - 116 hits, including the SIDBI Act and a Maharashtra marketing Act
that both have a section titled "Annual general meeting". Any check that takes
the first hit would confirm our Companies Act mapping against an unrelated
statute and report success. Results are therefore filtered on `act_name` before
anything is compared, and a section number with no Companies Act hit is reported
NOT_FOUND rather than matched against a neighbour.
