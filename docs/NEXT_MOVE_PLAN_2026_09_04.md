# Next-move plan & autonomous loop runbook — 2026-09-04

Written so work continues turn-over-turn while the operator is away. This file IS
the loop's durable state: each iteration reads the queue, does the next AUTONOMOUS
task, commits+pushes, ticks the box here, and schedules the next iteration. It is
pushed to the remote, so it survives context loss and the local-checkout-vanish
that already happened once this session.

## The one rule the loop must never break

**Do not perform a human-gated step.** Two are outstanding and neither may be
faked, because faking either corrupts the guarantee the whole system exists to
make:
- `--attest` G.S.R. 700(E): certifies a *person* checked identity + verbatim
  clause. A script self-attesting defeats the two-human-checks design.
- Lawyer/CS confirmation of "correct span" and obligation correctness (H-001).

While these are outstanding the loop works AROUND them; it does not decide them.

## Current state snapshot (what is real and green)

- Deterministic engine: obligation register, 8 obligations + deciders, small-co
  classify, E3→E6 entailment gate, evidence pack, loopback serve, benchmark
  governance. Full suite green.
- Currency engine (`checker/currency.py`) + pack LAW-CURRENCY WATCH wiring.
- Model plan (`docs/MODEL_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`), primary-source verified.
- **G.S.R. 700(E) downloaded, registered, PENDING_HUMAN_REVIEW** (sha256
  bb590caf…, committed). Small-company thresholds stay UNRESOLVED until the
  operator runs `--attest`.
- **Structural chunker (`checker/structural_chunk.py`)** — DONE this session.

## The autonomous queue (RAG/retrieval layer, model plan §3.3/§6)

Ordered. Each task: deterministic, self-tested ([PASS]/[FAIL], N/N), zero new
deps, one commit, full runner green before push. Tick when merged.

- [x] **T1 — Structural chunker.** `chunk_section()` splits a section on its own
  units (sub-section/proviso/roman sub-clause) with paths + spans + hashes.
  *Done, 21/21, pushed.*

- [x] **T2 — Structural corpus index.** `checker/structural_index.py`: build a
  path→chunk index across all ~529 sections (lazy, cached), plus
  `chunk_by_path("2(85)(i)")` and `chunks_for_section("96")`. Acceptance: every
  obligation's governing provision (s.96, s.173, s.149(1), s.149(3), s.137, s.92,
  s.135, s.2(85)) resolves to at least its sub-section chunk; s.2(85) resolves to
  both limbs. Guard: must not choke on a section whose HTML is malformed —
  degrade to a chapeau chunk, never raise.

- [x] **T3 — Retrieval returns structural chunks.** Add a function (do NOT break
  existing `retrieve()` tests) that, given a section (and optional path), returns
  the ranked structural chunks, each carrying its citation path + hash. Keep the
  existing admission/withheld-rules discipline. Acceptance: a query naming a
  section returns its chunks with paths; a withheld rule stays withheld.

- [x] **T4 — Chunk → E-gate candidate span.** `checker/ground_span.py`: given a
  model-proposed claim + a section, deterministically pick the best-matching
  structural chunk as the candidate witness span, then hand it to the existing
  E3→E6 cascade. This is the "model proposes, cascade disposes" wiring from the
  plan (§3.5). Acceptance: a claim about the small-company capital limit selects
  chunk 2(85)(i), and a claim unsupported by any chunk yields NOT_ESTABLISHED.
  Match deterministically (path mention, then term overlap); NO model in the
  selection path.

- [x] **T5 — Retrieval eval harness (scaffold).** `checker/retrieval_eval.py`: a
  frozen set of (question → expected chunk path) cases with a scorer
  (precision@1 / recall). Seed ONLY the entries derivable without legal judgement
  (e.g. "small company paid-up capital limit" → 2(85)(i); "AGM timing first year"
  → 96(1)/proviso[1]). Mark every semantically-judged entry `NEEDS_LAWYER` and
  EXCLUDE it from the score so no false green. Acceptance: harness runs, scores
  the seed set, and lists the NEEDS_LAWYER gaps as the H-001 ask.

- [x] **T6 — Wire structural citations into the pack.** When a pack row cites a
  provision, attach the structural chunk path + hash behind it (from T2), so the
  evidence pack cites "s.2(85)(i)" not just "s.2(85)". Acceptance: at least the
  small-company row shows a sub-clause-level citation; no bare statutory text
  (s.52(1)(q)(ii)); pack suite stays green.

## Human-gated (do NOT do in the loop — leave for the operator)

- [x] **H-A — Attest G.S.R. 700(E) (DONE: reviewer NS, 2026-09-04).** `python3 scripts/register_gsr700e.py
  --attest <id>` after eyeballing `corpus/sources/gsr700e_2022.pdf`. Then run the
  suite; commit the attested record; currency flips 2(85) → CURRENT. Prep the
  loop can do: nothing further — it is genuinely one operator command.
- [ ] **H-B — Lawyer confirms T5 NEEDS_LAWYER spans** and the obligation rows.
- [ ] **H-C — CS review via the validation kit (H-001).**

## Loop protocol (how each iteration runs)

1. Read this file; find the first unchecked `[ ]` task in the AUTONOMOUS queue.
2. If none remain (all done or only human-gated left): STOP the loop, write a
   final summary to this file, do not reschedule.
3. Otherwise: build it TDD-style — module with self-tests, run it, register in
   `scripts/run_tests.sh`, run the FULL suite, and only push if green.
4. One logical change per commit; push to `engine/entailment`; tick the box here
   and commit this file too.
5. Schedule the next iteration. On any failure that cannot be fixed in-iteration,
   write the blocker under the task, STOP, and leave it for the operator.

## Definition of "done for today"

The autonomous queue (T2–T6) merged and green, OR a blocker recorded and the loop
stopped honestly. The human-gated items (H-A/B/C) are the operator's and are not
part of today's autonomous completion — the highest-value one, H-A, is a single
command that unblocks small-company classification the moment the operator is back.

---

## LOOP COMPLETE — 2026-09-04 (end of session)

The autonomous queue T1–T6 is merged, tested, and pushed. The loop stopped
because only human-gated items remain, exactly as the protocol requires — it did
not invent further work.

**Shipped this session (all on `engine/entailment`, full runner green at each step):**
- G.S.R. 700(E): downloaded via the Composio browser tool (both the compliant
  fetcher and an HTML crawler failed; a real browser reached DSpace), verified,
  registered PENDING_HUMAN_REVIEW, committed. See [[project_placedon_gazette_acquisition]].
- Currency engine + pack LAW-CURRENCY WATCH.
- T1 structural chunker · T2 structural index · T3 structural retrieval ·
  T4 chunk→E-gate grounding · T5 retrieval eval (baseline p@1=0.20) ·
  T6 sub-clause span citations in the pack.
- Model-development plan, primary-source verified.

**The retrieval layer now exists end to end:** a section's text → structural
chunks (path+hash) → path-addressable index → admission-gated retrieval →
deterministic span selection → E3–E6 entailment → NOT_ESTABLISHED-or-cited. The
eval quantified the honest gap: lexical selection is weak over whole sections
(0.20), which is the measured case FOR the embedding layer — the next real build,
and the one narrow training the plan endorses.

**What the operator returns to (in priority order):**
1. **H-A — one command** unblocks small-company classification:
   `python3 scripts/register_gsr700e.py --attest <id>` (after eyeballing
   `corpus/sources/gsr700e_2022.pdf`), then `bash scripts/run_tests.sh`. Currency
   flips 2(85) → CURRENT; classify starts answering.
2. **H-B** — a lawyer resolves the `NEEDS_LAWYER` cases in `retrieval_eval.py`
   (the retrieval eval labels) and confirms the obligation rows.
3. **H-C** — CS review via the validation kit (H-001).

**Next autonomous build, when authorised:** the embedding layer (plan §3.4) to
beat the 0.20 retrieval baseline — but it wants the H-B lawyer labels first, so
it is correctly downstream of a human step, not ahead of one.

---

## CONTINUATION — retrieval measured, entity graph started

After H-A (700(E) attested, small-company thresholds live), autonomous work continued:

- **BM25 ranker** (`checker/lexical_rank.py`, zero deps): retrieval 0.20 → 0.62 on a
  widened 13-case eval. The embedding layer is now **staged and justified** but gated
  on a decision that is the operator's, not mine: add a heavy dependency
  (torch/sentence-transformers or a paid embedding API) vs. the "no new dependency"
  rule, AND expand the eval's semantically-hard cases (needs H-B lawyer labels). I
  stopped rather than overfit 13 cases or add a dependency unilaterally.
- **Corporate Entity Graph** (`checker/entity_graph.py`): the substrate for s.185/186/188
  — typed, dated, directed relationships with tri-state (absence ≠ denial) queries.
  Decides no obligation yet; it is the data structure the deciders build on.

### Open decision for the operator (embeddings)
- **A** — accept BM25 (0.62), revisit only if real usage demands it (most YAGNI).
- **B** — authorise a specific embedding dependency (name local vs. API); I build it.
- **C** — H-B lawyer labels first, widen the eval, then decide B on firm ground. (Recommended.)

### Next autonomous build (dependency-free, human-free): s.185/186/188 deciders
Now unblocked by the entity graph. Each is a decider over the graph + profile, same
five-state discipline as the existing obligations, feeding the register and the pack.
This is the path I will continue unless redirected.

---

## s.185 / s.186 / s.188 deciders — DONE

Built on the entity graph, each grounded in the corpus text (read, not recalled),
abstention-first:

- **s.185** (`checker/s185.py`, 11/11) — loans to directors. PROHIBITED /
  PERMITTED_WITH_CONDITIONS / EXEMPT / NOT_CAUGHT / CANNOT_DETERMINE. NOT_CAUGHT
  only when the counterparty is provably in none of the caught classes.
- **s.188** (`checker/s188.py`, 12/12) — related-party transactions, with the
  s.2(76) related-party test on the graph. The members'-approval limb sits behind
  an unacquired prescribed rule (S-188-RULES), flagged not guessed.
- **s.186** (`checker/s186.py`, 13/13) — loan/investment ceiling arithmetic,
  money-discipline (unknown ≠ zero); the two-layers limb noted as not modelled.
- Graph extended with incoming queries + directional completeness (23/23).

### Honest boundaries recorded (not hidden)
- s.188 members'-approval threshold and any s.185/188 prescribed rules are the
  same S-002-class gap — acquire via the browser+register+attest path
  ([[project_placedon_gazette_acquisition]]).
- s.2(76) KMP/manager and "accustomed-to-act" limbs are only partly modelled;
  negatives stay conservative (CANNOT_DETERMINE unless vouched).
- These deciders are transaction-scoped; wiring them into the obligation register
  / evidence pack (a company-level "do you have RPT/loan controls" row) is the
  natural next step, plus acquiring the s.188 threshold rule.

---

## Decision A taken — retrieval ships on BM25 (2026-09-04)

`checker/chunk_retrieval.py` is the shipped ranker (best/rank/search_section);
retrieval_eval scores exactly it (0.62); no dependency added. **Decision B: DEFERRED (2026-09-04).** Operator chose to keep BM25 and not add an
embedding dependency now. Retrieval is settled with zero new dependencies;
embeddings are revisited only if real usage shows 0.62 is not enough. The eval
(`retrieval_eval.py`) stays as the bar any future embedder must beat.

---

## RAG accuracy — cross-section retrieval built and measured

The retrieval eval only measured WITHIN a known section (0.62). The harder, truer
accuracy question — given a plain question, does retrieval reach the right SECTION
across the whole Act — is now built and measured:

- `checker/corpus_retrieval.py` — BM25 over all ~474 sections, heading boosted 5x,
  Producer Company regime (378*) demoted for general queries.
- `checker/cross_section_eval.py` — 45 plain-English questions → governing section
  (labels structural, read off section titles).
- **Measured: precision@1 = 0.73, recall@5 = 0.93** (zero dependencies).

recall@5 0.93 is the operational number: with a reviewer seeing the top five, the
right section is present 93% of the time. The 3 residual p@1 misses are vocabulary
gaps ("rights issue" absent from s.62's title; "disqualified" collides with s.167)
— semantic, the **embedding target (decision B, deferred)**, not lexically fixable
without overfitting 45 cases. The lexical accuracy loop is at its honest plateau.

Note: the planned sub-agent fan-out to expand the eval hit an account session
limit (resets ~21:50 IST); the eval was authored directly instead, since the
labels need no legal judgement. When the limit resets, sub-agents can widen it
further and re-measure — but the plateau conclusion is unlikely to move without B.
